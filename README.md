## 1\. Project Vision & Objective

The goal of this project was to create a clean, modern, and performant digital resume that serves as a central hub for my professional identity. By deliberately avoiding external libraries and frameworks like jQuery or React, the project showcases a strong command of **core web technologies**.

The primary objective is to present a comprehensive summary of my skills, projects, and experience in a single, accessible, and fully responsive page. The focus is on a high-quality user experience, demonstrating proficiency in **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

## 2\. Core Features & Functionality ‚ú®

This portfolio is packed with features designed to create an interactive and professional summary.

  - **Modern "About Me" Layout**: The introduction section features a side-by-side layout created with **CSS Flexbox**, placing the profile avatar to the left and a detailed biography to the right for a clean, readable introduction.

  - **Dynamic Skills Grid**: The skills section uses a **CSS Grid** layout to responsively display a collection of technical abilities. Each skill is presented in a "card" with its corresponding icon and years of experience.

  - **Detailed Project Showcase**: Lists key projects with descriptions of the technologies used and the problems solved, giving a clear insight into my development experience.

  - **Interactive Recommendation Form**: A standout feature of this portfolio.

      - Visitors can fill out a form to leave a recommendation.
      - Upon submission, the form data is captured using **vanilla JavaScript**.
      - A new recommendation card is dynamically created and appended to the recommendations section in real-time, without requiring a page reload. This is achieved through direct **DOM manipulation**.

  - **Fully Responsive Design**: The entire layout is fluid and adapts seamlessly to any screen size, from small mobile devices to large desktop monitors, ensuring a consistent and accessible experience for all users.

  - **Enhanced User Experience**: Includes user-friendly features like smooth scrolling for internal navigation links and a "Back to Top" button that appears on longer scrolls.

## 3\. Technical Stack & Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

This project was intentionally built using core web technologies to demonstrate foundational strength.

  - **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content with **semantic tags** for better accessibility and SEO.
  - **CSS3**: Heavily utilized for all styling, layout, and responsiveness.
      - **Flexbox** and **Grid** are used to create complex, modern, and responsive layouts.
      - **Media Queries** are implemented to handle different screen sizes.
      - **Transitions** are applied for smooth hover effects and other subtle animations.
  - **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers all client-side interactivity without any external libraries.
      - **Event Listeners** are used to handle form submissions and other user interactions.
      - **DOM Manipulation** is used to dynamically create and add new recommendation elements to the page in real-time.
